> Authentication is a ubiquitous problem in web applications. So
ubiquitous, in fact, that we might be inclined to think of ways
to "outsource" the problem of authentication to an external provider.

Solving these problems is one of the major focuses of OAuth. Using OAuth,
we can allow users to authenticate with our app via a 3rd-party service
provider (often a large online or social media service).
